___
### Example of the `cd` command: 
___
![cd command with NO arguments](cdnoArg.jpg)
- Working directory: `home`
- When `cd` is used with no arguments (meaning there's nothing after `cd` in the prompt), the user is returned to their home directory. Lack of output isn't an error, since we're changing directories without having to print any output. So when I write the command `pwd`, which prints our working directory, we're shown the path `/home`.
___
![cd command with DIR argument](cdDirArg.jpg)
- Working directory: `home`
- When we use `cd` with an argument that matches one of our directories, we move into that directory. Again, there's nothing printed after the command executes, but we can see that the prompt has changed on the next line to show that we are now in `lecture1`. Again, when I use `pwd`, `/home/lecture1` prints, showing us that we have moved into `lecture1`.
